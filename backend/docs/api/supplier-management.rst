Basic Supplier Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Available Operations:**
- Create supplier with basic information
- List suppliers for an account
- Get supplier details by ID

.. note::
   **Current Implementation Note:**
   
   The supplier management endpoints currently exist as placeholder implementations. They accept basic supplier data and return simple responses, but do not include the advanced features like invoice processing, document management, or inventory tracking shown in the planned features above.
