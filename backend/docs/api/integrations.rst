Integration APIs üöß
===============

.. note::
   **Implementation Status: In Development - Mixed Implementation**
   
   **Currently Available:**
   - iiko POS integration endpoints (``/v1/api/accounts/{account_id}/integrations/iiko/connect``, ``/status``)
   - Basic integration framework
   - Account-level integration credentials support
   
   **Documented But Not Fully Implemented:**
   - Azure OpenAI integration (endpoints documented but may not be fully functional)
   - Comprehensive menu synchronization
   - Advanced data transformation
   - Custom webhook management for integrations
   
   **Fully Functional:**
   - Telegram platform integration (via bot management system)
   
   The comprehensive features described in this documentation represent the planned integration capabilities.

The Integration APIs provide seamless connectivity with external systems including POS systems, AI services, payment processors, and third-party platforms. These APIs enable restaurant operators to connect their existing tools and services with the GET INN platform.

Basic iiko Integration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Connect iiko Integration:** ``POST /v1/api/accounts/{account_id}/integrations/iiko/connect``

**Get Integration Status:** ``GET /v1/api/accounts/{account_id}/integrations/iiko/status``

These endpoints provide basic iiko POS system integration capabilities. The current implementation supports connecting an account to iiko services and checking the integration status.

Usage Examples
==============
